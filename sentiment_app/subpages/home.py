    #  Sentiment Analysis Using Classical Machine Learning

    ###  **Abstract**
    This project presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis system leveraging classical machine learning algorithms to classify textual data based on emotional tone. The system employs robust natural language preprocessing techniques, vectorization strategies such as TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words, and dimensionality reduction via Singular Value Decomposition to optimize model performance. A diverse set of modelsâ€”including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Unsupervised Clusteringâ€”have been trained and evaluated under a unified pipeline. The platform features an interactive dashboard for real-time sentiment inference and model comparison, offering a scalable and extensible solution for text classification tasks in various domains.

    ## Project Overview

    This application is a unified platform for exploring, comparing, and simulating sentiment classification across various classical machine learning models. All models are trained using a consistent preprocessing pipeline and evaluated using common performance metrics.

    The backend supports:
    - **Text cleaning and normalization**
    - **TF-IDF and BOW vectorization**
    - **SVD-based dimensionality reduction**
    - **Scikit-learn based model training and serialization**

    The frontend provides:
    -  A clear dashboard for model comparison
    -  A live input simulator for real-time sentiment prediction
    -  Visuals to analyze model accuracy, F1 scores, and confusion matrices
